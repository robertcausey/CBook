\opening{Dear Members of the Equine Management Internship Selection Committee:} % eg Hello. % eg Hello.
It is a pleasure to write a letter of recommendation in support of Emma Locke's application to the Equine Management Internship Program at the Miner Institute. I have known Emma for over a year as her instructor and supervisor in UMaine's equine barn. In my opinion Emma is an excellent candidate for acceptance due to her excellent academic performance, equine experience, and personal profile.\\~\\
A review of Emma's transcript shows strong academic performance. She has a high GPA (> 3.2) covering two years of class work, and is clearly on track to graduate with a BS in Animal and Veterinary Sciences. \\~\\
Emma has strong animal skills in a variety of species, but especially horses. She has worked with me in the equine barn for over a year, demonstrating a high level of experience, ability, and reliability in performing equine care and training duties.  She also has taken on a leadership role in the equine barn, providing supervision for less experienced students and is Captain of the UMaine Equestrian team. In addition, she worked in the dairy barn, and received an A grade in the hands-on course involving care and management of dairy cattle (UMADCOWS). \\~\\
Emma's personal profile is excellent. She is outgoing, good-humored and reliable. Highly competent, she nevertheless is receptive to instruction. She is well - liked by students, staff, and faculty, and performs well alone or in a group. \\~\\
In summary, I believe Emma would be an excellent candidate for admission to the Miner Institute Equine Management Internship program on this application cycle. She is one of the most reliable and competent students we have recently had in the equine barn and I believe she would be a valuable asset to you. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like more information about Emma Locke.
\closing{\hspace{-5em}Sincerely,}
~\\~\\
