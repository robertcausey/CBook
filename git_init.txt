fatal: No configured push destination.                                   Either specify the URL from the command-line or configure a remote repository using                                                                                                                                            git remote add <name> <url>                                                                                                                   and then push using the remote name                                                                                                                   git push <name> 

******************************

Go on to github and creat a new repository with the name of the directory you are in locally. Copy and paste the URL then enter both by using the command

git remote add <name> <url>

when you do your first git push you will need to establish it as the master (I think), and will need to use the following command

git push --set-upstream <name> master
