\opening{Dear Naomi:} % eg Hello.
Many thanks for taking ownership of Jill Quirk ``Jill" or ``Jillybean". She has been a great mare for us over the years, and I am glad to see her going to a devoted owner like yourself. \\~\\
Today she is sold as is, and we can make no guarantee regarding her future performance. Other than old racing injuries which limit her athletic performance there do not appear to be any other significant issues regarding her health. However, we do not recommend that she be ridden.\\~\\
I hope  you will have many happy years together, and I know that the bond you share will become stronger as those years go by.
\closing{Sincerely} % eg Regards,
