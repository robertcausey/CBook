\opening{Dear Dean Servello:} % eg Hello.
I agree with the evaluation of Ms Eileen Molloy by the School of Food and Agriculture's Peer Review Committee, and I support her first annual reappointment.  As a new Lecturer in SFA, Ms Molloy has assumed responsibility as Undergraduate Coordinator for Food Science and Human Nutrition and Director for the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD), while delivering several classes in the FSN undergraduate curriculum. The high quantity and quality of her work meets or exceeds expectations of her 100\% teaching position and justifies her reappointment. \\~\\
Ms Molloy has a diverse load of many teaching responsibilities. Her current classes include FSN 202 (Foodservice Management), NFA 117 (Issues and Opportunities), FSN 103 (The Science of Food Preparation), FSN 305 (Foods Laboratory), and FSN 430 (Diet Counseling). She currently has 37 advisees.  She serves as undergraduate coordinator for the 5 undergraduate concentrations within FSN (Food Science; Human Nutrition and Dietetics; Food Management; premed + Food Science concentration; premed + Human Nutrition and Dietetics concentration).  Of these the Human Nutrition and Dietetics concentration (Didactic Program in Dietetics), is subject to review by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). As the DPD Director she has had to become familiar with the Standards for Didactic Programs in Dietetics established by ACEND, verify compliance, update student guidelines, coordinate faculty efforts to assess and document student learning outcomes, and gather data to assess program goals. \\~\\
To provide high quality teaching and advising appears to be a priority of Ms Molloy. She attended the Summer Institute for Effective Teaching in June 2018, and in October 2018 attended several workshops for educators sponsored by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. As the Didactic Program Director she specifically mentors students applying for dietetic internships (DI). To this end she offered a number of workshops including successfully applying for internships; work opportunities for students in food science and human nutrition (in conjunction with the career center); hosted a panel discussion of five Registered Dietitian Nutritionists who described work and careers available to RDNs; and met with dietetic internship applicants to review their application strategies.\\~\\
Based on her long career and credentials as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, Licensed Dietitian, and Certified Diabetes Educator, Ms Molloy has much to offer UMaine and the state in education, service and outreach. She is the current President of the Maine Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (MAND), and is heavily involved in the planning of this year's MAND Annual Conference, which will provide continuing education to Maine's nutritionists and dieticians. She is part of the Margaret Chase Smith Recipe collaborative which explores history, political science, and women through the lens of the recipes of Margaret Chase Smith. She helped review and provide training for the Live Well program on campus.  She also addressed an un-met need by creating a list of nutrition counseling services available in the University of Maine area.  \\~\\
In summary, Ms Molly has shown herself to be a valuable asset to UMaine and the State of Maine through her experience, education and willingness to serve. I strongly recommend her reappointment.
